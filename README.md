### Model
- We applied Gradient Boosting to predict the probability of any event being fraud
- As a baseline, we attempted predicting fraud probability based on  total fraud rate.  
  - This resulted in a log loss of 0.33 
- Our model  achieved a log loss of 0.06

- Predicted chance of fraud
  - Low: up to 0.5% 
  - Med: 0.5% to 70% 
  - High: x > 70%
- Fraud detection
  - Medium Threshold:
    - Model detects 99% of fraud
    - 44% FPR
  - High Threshold:
    - Model Detects 78% of Fraud
    - 0.4% FPR
